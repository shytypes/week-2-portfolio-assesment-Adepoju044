    <p class="Note">
      i have started my journey to becoming a frontend developer, and I'm loving
      every step of the learning process. I recently began training in web
      development, focusing on the core building blocks: HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript. It's all new to me, but I'm excited by how powerful these
      tools are for creating websites and bringing ideas to life. Right now, I'm
      working through online courses and tutorials, building small projects to
      practice what I'm learning. From basic layouts to interactive features,
      I'm slowly building up my confidence and understanding of how the frontend
      works. My goal is to grow into a well-rounded frontend developer who can
      create clean, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces. I know there's
      a lot to learn, but I'm staying curious, consistent, and open to every new
      challenge. This is just the beginning. I'm excited to keep learning, keep
      building, and see where this path takes me
